    description: "Ithaca College Utilities Database System and Google Drive UI is a project that I worked on during my time at Ithaca College. The project was a collaboration between the IT department and the Facilities department. The goal of the project was to create a system that would allow the Facilities department to easily access and update information about the utilities on campus. The system was built using Python and Django, and it included features such as a PDF Scraper, a database of information about each utility, and a user interface for updating the information. The project also included a Google Drive UI that allowed users to access and update documents related to the utilities. The project was a success, and it is still in use by the Facilities department at Ithaca College.",

The goal of the project was to create a system that would allow researchers to assess time awarness in children ages 8-12 in a more efficient and accurate way. The system was built using GDScript, and it included assessments that tested Prospective Memory Processing, Retrospective Time Evaluation, And More.

The goal of the project was to create a system that would allow researchers to track suburban habitat loss in the suburban development areas. The system was built using Python and TensorFlow, and the SAM (Segment Anything Model) by Meta and it included features such as a database of satellite images of the area, a machine learning model for analyzing the images, and a saletite image scraper that pulls satalite images over any area and time.",
