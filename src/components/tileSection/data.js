    description: "I’m a hardworking and passionate individual with a background in location sound recording, sound design, live event and studio production, and television production. I’m also well versed in softwares such as ProTools, Izotope RX, Adobe Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, and After Effects. While I enjoy all aspects of the production process, my main focus and interests lie on-set and in post-production. I love being on set because of the coordinated teamwork that it requires, and the perfectionist in me loves post-production for the ability to enhance the stories being told to make them as impactful as possible.
